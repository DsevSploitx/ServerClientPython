# ServerClientPython

A simple Python socket-based client-server application that demonstrates basic TCP communication.

## ðŸ“¦ Description

This project contains two Python scripts:
- `server.py` â€” A basic TCP server that listens for incoming client connections and prints received messages.
- `client.py` â€” A simple TCP client that connects to the server and sends a message.

This project is intended for learning and demonstration purposes.
